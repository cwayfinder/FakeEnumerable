When I first came to Ruby, one of the things that impressed me the most was the killer features provided by the `Enumerable` module. I eventually also came to love `Enumerator`, even though it took me a long time to figure out what it was and what one might use it for.

It is my own subset of the functionality provided by `Enumerable` and `Enumerator`.
